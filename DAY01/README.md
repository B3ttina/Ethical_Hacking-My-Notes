## Day 01: Introduction to Cybersecurity

### What is Cybersecurity?

Cybersecurity refers to the practice of protecting systems, networks, and sensitive data from digital attacks. It involves safeguarding information using the principles of the **CIA triad**:

- **Confidentiality:** Ensuring only authorized individuals have access to data.
- **Integrity:** Making sure the data remains accurate and unaltered.
- **Availability:** Keeping systems accessible to users when needed.

In essence, cybersecurity protects everything from personal devices to large organizational networks.

### Introduction to Encryption

Encryption is the process of converting readable data into an unreadable format to prevent unauthorized access.

- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses the same key for both encryption and decryption.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Utilizes a pair of public and private keys for secure data exchange.
